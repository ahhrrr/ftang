h1. FTANG!

Ftang! is a music jukebox (a la iTunes) that runs in your web browser.

h2. Requirements
  * gems: rack, sinatra, pow, haml, json
  * modern web browser (tested against recent firefox, chrome, and safari builds)
  * enough storage space to host your music collection

h2. Installation
<pre>
  <code>
    gem install sinatra pow haml json
    git clone git://github.com/maxogden/ftang.git && cd ftang
    unicorn config.ru
  </code>
</pre>

h2. Adding your music

By default Ftang! looks for your music at public/music. Your music should be organized in folders named for each artist. Each artist folder should contain folders named for each album. Each album folder should contain mp3 files and any album art. See the included example music directory for an example.
  
If you use iTunes then setup is very simple as you can sym-link to your iTunes music directory. By default, iTunes stores it's music in a hierarchy that is compatible with Ftang!
  
To sym-link your iTunes directory on OS X, execute the following commands from inside the ftang folder:
<pre>
  <code>
    mv public/music example_music
    ln -s ~/Music/iTunes\ Music/ music
  </code>
</pre>
